# COMS-4111-Project-1

This project is one of the projects in COMS 4111 Introduction to Database. For this project, my teammate and I collaborated together to build a video sharing database application.

The project is divided into 3 phases:
- **phase 1**: Design an ER diagram and list all the relevent information
- **phase 2**: Using PostgreSQL to implement our design database and populate our data base
- **phase 3**: Expand the DataBase Design to incorporate more features
